1. **Datatypes: 2 points**

Find a datatype that we have not discussed in class (don't forget to tell me what it is). List at least three functions that one could apply to the datatype you found.

An example solution:
datatype: `list`
+ `x.append()` – this method adds an element at the end of the list `x`
+ `x.pop(1)` – this method removes an element at a specified index position in the list `x` (1 in this case). The method returns that element, altering the list at the same time.

2. **Comparisons: 2 points**

What do the following numeric comparisons mean when they are applied to strings?
+ `==`
+ `!=`
+ `>`
+ `>=`
+ `<`
+ `<=`

A hint: `’flower’ < ’zebra’` precedes alphabetically

3. **Semitic morphology: 2 points**

Semitic morphology involves intercalating vowels and consonants to express morphological categories.
For example, the Arabic root *k,t,b* occurs in at least the following forms: *katab-a* ’he
wrote’, *kaatab-a* ’he corresponded’, *kutib-a* ’it was written’, *kitab* ’book’, *kuttaab* ’writers’, *uktub*
’write!’, etc.
How might you use `format()` to describe this system? Give a sample representation for the
root *k,t,b* and how `format()` could be used to express different categories.
