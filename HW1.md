1. Datatypes: 2 points

Find a datatype that we have not discussed in class (don't forget to tell me what it is). List at least three fuctions that one could apply to the datatype you found.

An example:
Datatype: list
+ x.append() – this method adds an element at the end of the list x
+ x.pop(1) – this method removes an element at a specified index position in the list x (1 in this case). The method returns that element, altering the list at the same time.

2. Comparisons: 2 points
